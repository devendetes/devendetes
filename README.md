# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniele, a Software Developer at Akhter Computers. I recently completed an IT Sol Technician Level 3 apprenticeship and hold a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Federico II in Naples. My move to London has enriched my technical skills, particularly in Android development.

## Expertise

- Android development with a focus on Android 13
- Jetpack Compose for modern UI development
- MVVM architecture with LiveData
- Room and Retrofit for efficient data management
- Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Testing and debugging using JUnit and Espresso
- Security implementation in Android 13
- CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions
- Device management in Lock Task mode
- Integration of third-party libraries like VLC and OSMDroid
- Technical documentation in LaTeX and Markdown
- Concurrent programming and thread safety
- Privilege escalation in Android using Termux and Shizuku

## Collaboration

I'm keen on leveraging my skills in collaborative open-source projects, particularly those involving Linux, such as writing drivers for unsupported hardware and documentation.
